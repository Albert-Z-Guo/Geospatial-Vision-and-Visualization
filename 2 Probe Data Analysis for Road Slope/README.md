# Code1: main.ipynb
This is the main program for all data processing and analysis.  
First put homework data files:    
**Partition6467LinkData.csv**  and  **Partition6467ProbePoints.csv**   
into this folder, and then use jupyter notebook to run:  
**main.ipynb**   
It takes 35-40 minutes to run through all the code.

# Code2: a test 
This is a test of another algorithm for road matching on a toy dataset.  
The algorithm is described in "Road Matching - v2" in the reprot.   
Run it by:   
$ cd road_matching_on_self-created_grid_map && python3 main.py  
and you will see the video animation of the implemented algorithm.
